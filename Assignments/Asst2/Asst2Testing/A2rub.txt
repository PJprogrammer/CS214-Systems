--- Testcases: (60pts total)
Test0: 9pts
called on a directory holding three files, each holding "hello!".
	+3pts: outputs correct number of lines (3)
	+2pts: outputs correct JSD (0)
	+2pts: outputs correct color
	+2pts: outputs correct names (filenames only, -1pt)

Test1: 9pts
called on a directory holding three files each holding, respectively: "hello!" , "Hello." and "hello?"
	+3pts: outputs correct number of lines (3)
	+2pts: outputs correct JSD (0)
	+2pts: outputs correct color
	+2pts: outputs correct names (filenames only, -1pt)

Test2:	10pts
called on a directory holding a file and a subdirectory, subdirectory holds five concatenated layers of subdirectories, the last with one file.
	+3pts: outputs correct number of lines (1)
	outputs correct JSD:
		+2pts	log10: 0.0469
		+1pt	log2: 0.1556
	+3pts: outputs correct color
	+2pts: outputs correct names (filenames only, -1pt)

Test3:	12pts
called on a directory holding two large files..
	+3pts: outputs correct number of lines (1)
	outputs correct JSD:
		+4pts:	log10: 0.1193
		+3pts:	log2: 0.3964
	+3pts: outputs correct color
	+2pts: outputs correct names (filenames only, -1pt)
   ( shouldn't explode! )

Test4: 12pts
called on a directory holding two files and a subdirectory that holds a file and a subdirectory that holds another file.		
	+3pts: outputs correct number of lines  (3)
	 outputs correct JSDs:
		+2pts	log10:
						file0 and file2: 0.3
						file0 and file1: 0.26
						file1 and file2: 0.18
		+1pt	log2:
						file0 and file2: 1
						file0 and file1: 0.88
						file1 and file2: 0.6
	+3pts: output in correct order:
		file0 and file2
		file0 and file1
		file1 and file2
	+3pts:	outputs correct color(s)
	+2pts: outputs correct names (filenames only, -1pt)

Test5: 8pts
called on a directory holding two files and a subdirectory, which holds a file and a subdirectory that are both read- and execute-protected.
	+2pts: outputs correct number of lines (1)
	outputs correct JSD:
		+2pts:	log10: 0.0937
		+1pt:	log2: 0.3113
	+2pts: outputs correct color
	+2pts: outputs correct names: (filenames only, -1pt)
