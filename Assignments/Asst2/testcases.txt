    - check if hyphens are included in token (e.x. "upper-case") -> Token: "upper-case"
    - check if punctuation and other symbols are ignored (e.x. "upper&-&case") -> "upper-case"
    - check if upper-case is converted to lower-case (e.x. "UPPER-CASE") -> Token: "upper-case"
    - check if any delimiter will cause current token to end

4. Check if program will return 0.000 (in red color) for files containing the same tokens

    File 2: "this is my plagiarized homework haha"

    Output: 0.000 File 1 and File 2

5. Check if program will return 0.151 (in green color) for file with tokens and an empty file
    File 1: "this is my plagiarized homework haha"

    File 1: 10 tokens
    File 2: 5 tokens
    File 3: 15 tokens

    score File2 and File1 (Priority: 5+10=  15)
