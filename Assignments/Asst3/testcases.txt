Note: We created a testing client service in order to properly test each one of the test cases below.

Testing:
    1. We tested if our read() function would detect error messages sent from client side by building a client and
       sending error messages for (message 0, message 2, message 4).
        ex. "ERR|M0CT|", "ERR|M2CT|", "ERR|M4CT|", ...

    2. We tested if our read() function would detect message format error if message sent from client had an invalid
       number.
        ex. "REG|1a2|Who's there?|"

    3. We tested if our read() function would detect message format error if message sent from client had too few pipes.
        ex. "REG12|Who's there?|", "REG|12Who's there?|"

    4. We tested if our read() function would detect message format error if message send from client had too many
       pipes.
        ex. "REG||12|Who's there?|", "R|EG|12|Who's there?|", "REG|12||Who's there?|", "REG|12|Who's there?||"

    5. We tested if our read() function would detect message format error if message send from client did not contain
       a message type.
        ex. "|12|Who's there?|"

    6. We tested if our read() function would detect message length error if message sent from client had a length
           that does not correspond to the length of the message being sent.
            ex. "REG|125|Who's there?|"

    7. We tested length errors for message 1 and message 3 by adding/removing characters.
        (sent from client to server)
         ex. "REG|13|Who's theree?|", "REG|11|Who's ther?|"

    8. We tested content errors for message 1, message 3, message 5 by adding/removing/replacing characters and
       punctuation. (sent from client to server)
        ex. "REG|12|Who's thare?|", "REG|12|I disgusted4|"

    9. We tested to make sure that the server would gracefully exit if the client closed the connection early.

    10.We tested what would happen in a corner case if the last pipe is missing. We found out that the server's read
       function will block indefinitely as long as client is alive. We do NOT have to handle this case per instructor.
        ex. "REG|12|Who's there?"
